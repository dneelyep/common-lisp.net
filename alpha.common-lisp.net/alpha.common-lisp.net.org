#+HTML: <h3> What is Common Lisp? </h3>

Common Lisp is the modern, multi-paradigm, high-performance, compiled,
ANSI-standardized descendant of the long-running family of Lisp
programming languages.

Common Lisp is known for being extremely flexible, having excellent
support for object oriented programming, and fast prototyping
capabilities. It also sports an extremely powerful macro system that
allows you to tailor the language to your application, and a flexible
run-time environment that allows modification and debugging of running
applications (excellent for server-side development and long-running
critical software).

Common Lisp is a multi-paradigm programming language that allows you
to to choose the approach and paradigm according to your application
domain.

** The Site

The site [[http://common-lisp.net][Common Lisp.net]] has project hosting and mailing lists. 

It is run and paid for by [[file:{lisp}(ob:path-to-root){/lisp}/contribute.html][Common Lispers.]] 

#+HTML:  <lisp>(ob:insert-template "plugin_disqus.html")</lisp>

* Project Hosting
  :PROPERTIES:
  :PAGE:     project-hosting.html
  :END:

** Project Hosting

We offer projects web space, mailing lists, and disk space for a
version control system. We have git, Subversion, darcs and CVS.


** Creating a project

Send an email to admin (at) common-lisp (dot) net with details about
your project (your full name, your SSH public key, description of
project, any members (and their full names), name of project and what
license the code is released under). Hosting decisions are made on
case-by-case basis.

If your application is accepted a project directory owned by you, with
project-name as its group will be created at
/project/<project-name>. Any project members are simply made members
of group project-name.

As a first step, please take some time to add a simple web-page for
your project. The quickest alternative edit the HTML for our sample
project. After editing it to fit your project, you can upload it to
our server (via scp). See also our section titled "Website".

There are no limits placed on how much space you can use but please
exercise care; you will be sharing this system with others. No CPU/RAM
intensive tasks are to be performed on the server. You have shell
access but don't use it unless you need to perform administrative
tasks.

Email to your account @common-lisp.net will be forwarded to the email
address that you have supplied in your account application. Edit the
file .forward in your home directory to change the forwarding address.

** CVS access

Your CVS repository is in /project/<project-name>/cvsroot. By default,
any commits to it will be sent to <project-name>-cvs@common-lisp.net.

Anonymous read-only CVS access is enabled by default (see FAQ), though
it lags behind the writable repository by 15 minutes.

Your CVS repository will also be available through the web at
http://common-lisp.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/?cvsroot=<project-name>.

** Subversion access

Your Subversion repository is in /project/<project-name>/svn. By
default, any commits to it will be sent to
<project-name>-cvs@common-lisp.net.

Anonymous read-only Subversion access is enabled by default (see FAQ).


** Repositories over the web

Your CVS and Subversion repositories are viewable over the web by
default as long as you don't change the default configuration. For
darcs you have to create your repositories in
/project/<project>/public_html/darcs/ and a nightly cronjob will pick
them up and add them to the darcsweb config file. top Website

/project/<project-name>/public_html is symlinked to from our webserver
hierarchy and any files you put there will be available by pointing
your webbrowser to http://common-lisp.net/project/<project-name>

We would like to ask you to put up a minimal webpage as soon as
possible (an empty directory does not say much about your
project). The quickest way is to edit the HTML of our sample project
page.

Apache Server-Side Includes are enabled.


** Automatic and manual mailinglists

When your project is set up, three mailinglists are created (if you'd
rather use NNTP you can subscribe Gmane to your list):

<project-name>-devel
<project-name>-announce
<project-name>-cvs

You, the owner, are subscribed to all of these mailinglists by
default. Any members added later will have to subscribe to the ones
they want on their own, via the Mailman interface at:

http://lists.common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/<project-name>-devel
http://lists.common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/<project-name>-announce
http://lists.common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/<project-name>-cvs

Additional mailing lists available on request.

To stay up-to-date with all releases that are announced on the various
mailinglists you simply need to be subscribed to the announcements
mailinglist as this mailinglist is in turn subscribed to all
<project-name>-announce lists.


** Administrative requests

For adding/removing project members, additional mailing lists, etc,
send an email to admin (at) common-lisp (dot) net with all the
relevant details (project name, etc).


** List of project members

Every night a cronjob runs which generates a list of users who have
write access to your repositories and files. This list is placed in
/var/www/pprinted-project-members/<project>. You may use Apache SSI to
include this list on your project's web page, ie <!--#include
virtual="../../pprinted-project-members/<project> -->


** Restoring from backup

We do not keep offsite backups so for all intents and purposes you
must assume that there are no backups of any data. Please govern
yourself accordingly.


** Auto-nagging

We have cronjobs which look for broken links, to see if you have
changed from the default webpage, etc. If they detect any problems
they will nag you about it every week until you fix the problem. To
which email address are these nags sent? By default,
<project-name>-devel@common-lisp.net however you can change this by
creating a file named /project/<project-name>/owner-email-address and
putting whatever email address you want in there. Only put your email
address there or someone who has given you permission to do so; if you
misuse this your project's approval is rescinded.


** Trac

We offer a Trac instance for projects who would like one. Please
specify if want one when you set up your project or email admin (at)
common-lisp (dot) net to request it for an existing project.

To learn more about how Trac works at common-lisp.net, please read our

*** Why does my page look ugly/un-styled?

Maybe you are using [[https://www.google.com/chrome/][Google Chrome]] and you're trying to view your site
locally using a =file:///path/to/your/site/out/index.html= scheme.
Open the JavaScript console =Ctrl+Shift+I= and you should see
something like:

#+begin_example
XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///path/to/your/site/out/out/style/css/o-blog.less. Cross origin requests are only supported for HTTP.
less-1.2.1.min.js:8Uncaught Error: NETWORK_ERR: XMLHttpRequest Exception 101
#+end_example

If so, that is a known Chrome issue with loading local javascript
files, and is actually a /security feature/ in Chrome.

You can disable this with the =--allow-file-access-from-files= option
in Chrome, or you can use another browser like Firefox, or setup a
local webserver.

To use a local webserver, there are many complex solutions such as
[[http://nginx.org/][nginx]] or [[http://httpd.apache.org/][Apache]] or many [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_web_server_software][others]]. If you prefer a lighter and simpler
solution using Python, simply run:

#+begin_src sh
cd /path/to/your/site && python -m SimpleHTTPServer
#+end_src

...and browse http://localhost:8000

Or within Emacs you can run the [[https://github.com/jrhbailey/emacs-http-server][emacs-http-server]]:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'httpd)
(setq httpd-root "/path/to/your/site")
(httpd-start)
#+end_src

...and browse http://localhost:8080

Another alternative would be the use of [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Elnode][elnode]] but it seems to be more
complex.


*** Why html pages are not minified?

HTML compression very tricky. Things can easily go wrong. Using a
[[http://betterexplained.com/articles/how-to-optimize-your-site-with-gzip-compression/][GZip
compression]] would be more efficient.

Anyway if you still want to minify your pages, you can have a look to
[[http://code.google.com/p/htmlcompressor/][htmlcompressor]],
[[http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/][yuicompressor]] and
[[https://developers.google.com/closure/compiler/][Closure compiler]]. You
can also read Juriy Zaytsev's articles on
[[http://perfectionkills.com/optimizing-html/][optimizing HTML]] and
[[http://perfectionkills.com/experimenting-with-html-minifier/][experimenting
with html minifier]].

So here is the magic! Once your site is generated, you can run the following command:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
htmlcompressor --compress-js --compress-css --recursive --mask '*.js;*.html;*.xml;*.css;*.less' -o /path/to/out/ /path/to/out
#+END_SRC

** DONE The Server must move					     :cl@net:
   CLOSED: [2013-03-05 Tue 22:03]

 The company which hosts the dedicated server on which common-lisp.net
 is run is not offering such a service anymore, and the server itself
 is old and out of date. Because of this, we must migrate a lot to a
 new service.

 This machine, http://alpha.common-lisp.net/, is running on the new
 server, so it is simply moving things over. Still, there is a lot, so
 =if you can help, please leave a comment below= or [[mailto:drewc@drewc.org][email me]].

 There is also the matter of the future itself, what we offer and what
 we can do to help the lisp community. I was planning on having a bit
 more thought on this matter before asking others, but since this has
 come up, I figure that now is a good time to ask for input as well.

 If you happen to be able to [[https://www.paypal.com/xclick/business%3Dtreasurer%2540cl-foundation.org&currency_code%3DEUR&item_name%3DDonation%2520common-lisp%252Enet&lc%3DGB][Donate]] some time, skills or funds, it
 would really help move things along. If you happen to
 IRC, #common-lisp.net on freenode is the place. Otherwise, comments
 and email will be read and dealt with promptly.

** TODO Scripting with SBCL : Unix Admin from command line

For the new =Common Lisp.net=, there is a Single Sign On (SSO)
involved. This way, the same user id and password can be user for
multiple boxes as well as the soon-to-come web application. 

What that means is that, for now, Kerberos and LDAP are used where
=/etc/{passwd,groups,shadow]= was used before.

** DONE Migration Finished					     :cl@net:
   CLOSED: [2011-06-05 Sat 21:50]

#+BEGIN_HTML
      Migration has come to a close. Nearly all services are up and running
      again, with the exception of Arch and ArchZoom, for which support
      has been dropped. Here's a list of other changes:</p>

      <ul>
      <li>WebSVN repository browsing has been replaced:
        Subversion repository browsing is now handled by ViewVC.
	<li>The mailing list web interface is now hosted
	  on <a href="http://lists.common-lisp.net/">lists.common-lisp.net</a>
	  <li>Subversion anonymous checkout is now also supported over HTTP
	    through http://svn.common-lisp.net/&lt;project&gt;
	    <li>Trac has been upgraded to 0.11.7
	    <li>The standard Subversion post-commit hook integrates
	      with Trac tickets, if a project also has Trac set up. To
	        learn more about this integration, read
		  <a href="http://trac.edgewall.org/browser/tags/trac-0.11.7/contrib/trac-post-commit-hook"
		       >the within-script documentation from the Trac repository</a>
		       </ul>

#+BEGIN_HTML
      We're moving common-lisp.net to a new server.  In the process, all
      services will be completely reconfigured from scratch, with each service
      moving to its own subdomain.  This work is likely to cause service
      interruptions over the coming weeks.  If you want to offer a helping
      hand, please join <b>clo-devel at common-lisp.net</b>, where the
      process is being discussed and coordinated.</p>

** DONE New Administrator wanted				     :cl@net:
   CLOSED: [2007-09-10 Sat 21:38]

      Due to commitments at work I'm unable to provide adequate support
      to common-lisp.net.  The result of which is that there are several
      outstanding project applications (sorry guys, hope to get to them
      this week) and other misc tasks.  I'm looking for someone to take
      over the day-to-day administration of common-lisp.net - I'll be
      happy to keep paying for the site and manage the donations (though
      equally happy to give that up as well).  Email admin (at) common-lisp.net
      if you are interested.  The chores involves mostly a couple of shell
      scripts that take care of adding users and projects.
** DONE Extended Filesystem					     :cl@net:
   CLOSED: [2007-03-19 Sat 21:22]

      We extended the filesystem with another 5G last night which resulted
      in it being left in a read-only state without us noticing right away.
      Sorry for the inconvenience, all is well now.

** DONE Reboot							     :cl@net:
   CLOSED: [2006-09-19 Sat 21:21]

      While the hoster was performing a filesystem backup we experienced
      a failure which eventually led to a reboot.  All should be fine again,
      apologies for the inconvenience.

** DONE Domain Issues						     :cl@net:

      We had 30 minutes of network outage today from our upstream vendor.  The box
      stayed running the entire time but please let me know if there were any side-effects
      from this that I can help with.
** DONE Move is complete
   CLOSED: [2006-02-24 Sat 21:12]
      Move is complete.  FTP will trickle in over the next few days.  Please email
      me at erik.enge@gmail.com if there any problems.  Thanks.
** DONE New Server						     :cl@net:
   CLOSED: [2006-02-22 Sat 21:07]

      Tomorrow, Thursday the 23rd from 6PM EST, common-lisp.net will be unavailable for 24+ hours.
      We are moving to a new server and a new colocation facility in an effort to
      deal with our stability issues.  Thanks for your patience and sorry for the
      inconvenience.  Check here and comp.lang.lisp for updates on when we are back
      online.
** DONE More Diskspace						     :cl@net:
   CLOSED: [2006-02-03 Sat 21:05]
      We'll have a short period of downtime this Saturday at 8PM EST.
      The hosting provider will be adding more diskspace to our server
      as we are currently about to exceed the 20G we were originally
      given.  We should be back up again by 8:30PM EST.
** DONE Bad COLO Provider					     :cl@net:
   CLOSED: [2006-01-28 Sat 21:03]

       It seems that our hosting provider's colo provider is
       completely incompetent.  We're now on our third downtime in one
       week and have made the obvious decision to move to another
       colocation facility.  I'm sorry about all the downtime and
       inconveniences.  My hosting provider (Tech Co-op) tells me they
       will try and move us into a new colo some time next week.  In
       the mean time, I'm terribly sorry to have to provide such an
       unreliable service and hope the users will bear with us until
       we have this resolved.

#+BEGIN_HTML
      Thanks to Erik Huelsmann for helping me set up Subversion on common-lisp.net.
       Now all projects have a default Subversion repository set up in /project/project-name/svn
       correctly configured to email commits to project-name-cvs@common-lisp.net.  If you want to
       continue using arch, darcs or CVS, that's fine and if you want to move onto Subversion
       that should now be very easy to do.  <a href="http://lists.common-lisp.net/mailman/listinfo/clo-devel">Let me know</a>
       if there are any questions or problems.

We experienced an hour or so of downtime today, again.  The server was
powercycled (electrician flipped wrong breaker) and didn't come back
up correctly because of a corrupted filesystem (well, a small part of
it; fixed now).
